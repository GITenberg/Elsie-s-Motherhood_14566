description: Elsie and Edward take great delight in their burgeoning family.  The
  aftermath of the Civil War provides them with many opportunities to uphold their
  heritage and faith in practical ways, but are caught up in a campaign against a
  powerful adversary -- the Ku Klux Klan -- as they fight to protect the innocent
  from unjust persecution.
